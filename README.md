# Udemy Lecture Downloader
 They say necessity is the mother of invention and it is true when it comes to this repo. I created this chrome extension because I wanted to download the udemy lectures
 in one click and not just type a javascript code everytime I feel the need to download the lecture that I find useful. Well there is nothing to fear because I made it possible.
 Seriously, it isn't much of a big deal. But to be honest, I found it quite useful to use.
 
 If there are any issues that arise while making use of it please do inform me.

Works on following websites:-
* [coursera](https://www.coursera.org)
* [udemy](https://www.udemy.com)

# Instructions
* This is an unpacked chrome extension. Download the zip file and extract the folder somewhere suitable for you.
* Open the chrome browser. Type <code> chrome://extensions</code> in the URL input of the browser.
* On top right, toggle open the "Developer mode".
* And press the button "Load unpacked extension". Browse for the folder you unzipped and then start your extension!
The extension is capable of downloading videos from coursera and udemy for now. The extension will ask confirmation to download the lecture and then download it automatically for you. In case of coursera the video opens in a new tab and then you can just right click and save as the video.
