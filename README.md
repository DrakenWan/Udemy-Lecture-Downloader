# Udemy Lecture Downloader
 They say necessity is the mother of invention and it is true when it comes to this repo. I created this chrome extension because I wanted to download the udemy lectures
 in one click and not just type a javascript code everytime I feel the need to download the lecture that I find useful. Well there is nothing to fear because I made it possible.
 Seriously, it isn't much of a big deal. But to be honest, I found it quite useful to use.
 
 If there are any issues that arise while making use of it please do inform me.
